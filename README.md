Disclaimer: This was before I realized Google Tasks exists.

## Introduction

This Flutter app lets you integrate the simplistic TODO tasklist and the complicated Google Calendar
to get the bost of both world. For me, personally, Google Calendar was always something way too
complicated to quickly jot down all the tasks you will be doing, while also looking at those tasks
in a neat, concise place. But, unlike Google Calendar, you cannot easily manage your time and
get a intuitive idea how much each of those tasks/events are taking up your day. Thus, I present this
app as to combine the best of both world.
